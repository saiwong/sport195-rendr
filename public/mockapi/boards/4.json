The Mets drop their first road series of the 2013 season, losing 2 of 3 games against the hated Philadelphia Phillies. Here are the 3 Up and 3 Down from this series. Amazing Matt: Matt Harvey pitched the series opener on Monday night, and was spectacular once again. Harvey went seven innings giving up only one run. So far this season Matt is 2-0 with a 0.64 ERA and 19 (yes 19), strikeouts. Truth be told, I missed Mon...",

		"description": " The Marlins' Giancarlo Stanton hit 93 home runs in his first 371 games, leading MLB in slugging percentage last year as a 22-year-old. He's under team control through 2016 and hasn't gotten expensive yet. The Marlins sliced payroll drastically in the November blockbuster with the Blue Jays, but Stanton won't even be arbitration eligible until after this season. If we look at the examples of Miguel Cabrera and Josh Beckett, they were traded with three years of big league service time, a point ...",

Much of it has stemmed from Jacobs' open desire to return, with fuel being added to the fire when a report surfaced that Big Blue has left that door open. Well, chalk defensive end Justin Tuck up as someone else who'd like for that reunion to happen. While appearing at P.S. 21 for an NFL Play 60 event on Thursday, Tuck said he would love for Jacobs to return to the G...",

This Mets Team Can’t Afford Mental Mistakes I cringed as Domonic Brown’s three-run home run in the bottom of the first inning disappeared deep into the stands at Citizens Bank Park last night. Phillies 5, Mets 0 before we even blinked. But then I realized that Citizens Bank Park is band box, and one or two big swings would get the Mets right back in the game. Sure enough, homers from the red-hot John Buck and Lucas Duda made it a 5-2 game heading into the fifth. With one out an...",
